  - 1 bust will be "before" the waypoint, 1 will be north and 1 will be south.
  - What counts as "north" and "south" is a bit tricky. It's fine if you accidentally farm this zone while looking for the busts, the monsters are quite dangerous so it's best to find them quickly and farm City of Sarn if possible.
